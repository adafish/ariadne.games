      <h3>Co-Development</h3>
      <p>Co-development is a development partnership where two or more companies collaborate on a game. Whether you need an engineering team to optimize your game, fix bugs, develop specific features, or partner with you as co-engineers throughout your game's lifecycle, Ariadne Games is here to support your development efforts. 
        <a href="/contact.html">Start a discussion about co-development with Ariadne Games.</a></p>
      <h3>Pre-Production</h3>
      <p>
        During the preproduction phase, game studios plan, test, and refine their concepts. Robust pre-production planning can carry a game studio through countless development challenges. <a href="/contact.html">Start a discussion with Ariadne Games about our pre-production services</a> to learn how we can help you set clear and achievable goals for your team.</p>

        <summary><strong>Concept & Documentation</strong></summary>
        <p>&nbsp;A game design document is a software design document that serves as a blueprint for a game. Building a good game design document before you start development ensures that the game you release into the world is the best version of the one that lives in your head. Ariadne Games will work with you to scaffold your game through documentation; our process will help you refine your game's vision, communicate goals between departments, settle priority and scheduling questions, and resolve blockers and design conflicts before you encounter them. Because a good game design document is also a living document, we will also educate your team on how to keep your game design document up-to-date as your game evolves.</p>

        <summary><strong>Prototyping</strong></summary>
        <p>&nbsp;In game development, a prototype is a low-frills model of a game concept or mechanic. A meaningful prototype allows studios to seek early player feedback, test and refine mechanics, and prove whether or not a planned feature is worth developing. Ariadne Games has significant experience with rapid prototyping; through our 10 years of game jamming and our professional background in developing experiences on limited timelines, we are uniquely prepared to prototype the features you need to test.</p>

        <summary><strong>Timeline Estimation</strong></summary>
        <p>&nbsp;A development timeline helps you determine which features to cut and which to keep, pinpoint personnel gaps on your team, and set publisher/investor expectations. If you're struggling to determine how long it will take to develop your game concept, Ariadne Games will work with you to estimate a realistic timeline that takes your resources into account. We can also offer feedback on existing timelines.</p>
